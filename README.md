# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation (EVMS)


This repository explores the electric vehicle (EV) market through segmentation analysis. By dividing the market into distinct consumer groups, we can gain valuable insights to:

Understand consumer preferences and needs for EVs
Develop targeted marketing strategies for different EV segments
Identify potential growth opportunities within the EV market
This codebase provides a framework for analyzing the EV market using various segmentation approaches.

## Functionality
This repository includes scripts for segmenting the EV market based on several factors:

**Product Type**: Categorize EVs by technology (BEV, PHEV, HEV, etc.)
**Vehicle Specifications**: Segment EVs by factors like range, battery capacity, and performance.
**Price**: Group EVs based on their affordability to target budget-conscious or premium buyers.
**Target Market**: Identify potential customer segments based on demographics, behaviors, and environmental attitudes.

**Note: The specific functionalities might require additional data sets depending on your chosen segmentation approach**


Use code with caution.
